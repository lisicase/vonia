## Introduction

### Summary

Welcome! Spotty (Spot-a-Potty) is a mobile-first web application to help people find public restrooms that fit their needs so that they can save time and have better peace of mind.

We plan to create a web app that shows nearby public restrooms and allows for crowdsourced reviews of the bathrooms. Not only will users be able to find locations in advance, but also review crowdsourced ratings and other information—to evaluate whether the restroom lives up own cleanliness standard and/or has any preferred features—prior to visiting the location.

### Background

Public bathrooms can often be difficult to find; there's little way of knowing in advance of entering a bathroom whether it is clean or if there's a better one nearby. Additionally, public restrooms are slowly becoming even more scarce as the pandemic continues to dominate our lives. Both of these points pose a significant problem, particularly for those who have to be on the move frequently (gig workers, contract workers, the unhoused) and overall public health.

We aim to help address this problem by making it easy for users to quickly find restrooms in convenient locations and to learn about a specific location to decide what works best for them.

### Authors

We, Vonia, are a group Informatics students at the University of Washington in Seattle working on a final capstone project.
